There are many Open Graph meta tags that provide different information to Facebook. These tags can be added to your pages manually, either directly to the code on the page or through a CMS if fields are available or also programatically. Below are the most common Open Graph tags you will encounter with a brief description of each.

og:title – The title of your page, content, object etc. as you would like for it to appear when displayed on Facebook.

og:site_name – the name of your site.

og:description – Perhaps the most important tag. This is the 1-2 sentence snippet that shows up in the post. Write this carefully as this can be the difference between getting clicks or not.

og:type – The type of content. Think of these as categories, hotel, blog, article etc. Click here for a full list of Open Graph types.

og:image – The URL for an image you want to represent the your content. Images must be either PNG, JPEG and GIF formats and at least 50px by 50px.

og:url – This will be the URL that will be associated with your content ie the link.

Basic Metadata
To turn your web pages into graph objects, you need to add basic metadata to your page. We've based the initial version of the protocol on RDFa which means that you'll place additional <meta> tags in the <head> of your web page. The four required properties for every page are:

og:title - The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock".
og:type - The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.
og:image - An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.
og:url - The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".
As an example, the following is the Open Graph protocol markup for The Rock on IMDB:

<html prefix="og: http://ogp.me/ns#">
<head>
<title>The Rock (1996)</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="The Rock" />
<meta property="og:type" content="video.movie" />
<meta property="og:url" content="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/" />
<meta property="og:image" content="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" />
...
</head>
...
</html>
Optional Metadata
The following properties are optional for any object and are generally recommended:

og:audio - A URL to an audio file to accompany this object.
og:description - A one to two sentence description of your object.
og:determiner - The word that appears before this object's title in a sentence. An enum of (a, an, the, "", auto). If auto is chosen, the consumer of your data should chose between "a" or "an". Default is "" (blank).
og:locale - The locale these tags are marked up in. Of the format language_TERRITORY. Default is en_US.
og:locale:alternate - An array of other locales this page is available in.
og:site_name - If your object is part of a larger web site, the name which should be displayed for the overall site. e.g., "IMDb".
og:video - A URL to a video file that complements this object.
For example (line-break solely for display purposes):

<meta property="og:audio" content="http://example.com/bond/theme.mp3" />
<meta property="og:description" 
  content="Sean Connery found fame and fortune as the
           suave, sophisticated British agent, James Bond." />
<meta property="og:determiner" content="the" />
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_GB" />
<meta property="og:locale:alternate" content="fr_FR" />
<meta property="og:locale:alternate" content="es_ES" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="IMDb" />
<meta property="og:video" content="http://example.com/bond/trailer.swf" />
